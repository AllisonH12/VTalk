# VTalk
A project to translate a sketch or sounds into expression.  

Vtalk is a super cool app designed for kids with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to express themselves through sketches. It uses AI to translate their drawings into words, making communication easier and more enjoyable for them. Vtalk is the perfect way for kids with ASD to communicate using their own unique visual language.
